Installation & Running:
1. Clone the project from GitHub into your Eclipse workspace folder. 

2. Go into 'File' > 'Import' > 'General' > 'Existing Projects into Workspace'. Press next. 
Browse for the project in your Workspace folder and click ok. 

3. Open CS48 > src > game > LevelLoader.java and press Run. This generates the file for level 1 and it's

Playing the game:
You only use the mouse or your touchpad in this game.
When you start the game you collect a green play object which appears on the screen by hovering the
mouse over the object. Once you collect the play object you will see collectible items appear on the screen and a
black box/boxes. You are supposed to collect all the collectible items without hitting the wall or 
the black box. The black box follows you around the screen. If you collect all the collectible items on the screen
you win that level and go on to the next level. When you've finished all the levels you win the game. Good luck!
